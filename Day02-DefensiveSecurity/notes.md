# Day 02 â€“ TryHackMe Lab: Introduction to Defensive Security


## Objective
Gain foundational knowledge of defensive security, focusing on the role of a Security Operations Center (SOC) and the core practices in Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR).

## Key Topics Covered
### Security Operations Center (SOC)
- Acts as the central unit for monitoring, detecting, and responding to security events.
- Utilizes **Threat Intelligence** to stay ahead of adversaries.

### Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)
- **Incident Response (IR):** Process of managing and handling security breaches.
- **Malware Analysis:** Investigating malicious software to understand its behavior and impact.

## The 4 Phases of Incident Response
1. **Preparation**  
   - Build and train an incident response team.  
   - Implement preventive measures to reduce the chance of incidents.  

2. **Detection and Analysis**  
   - Detect potential incidents with monitoring tools.  
   - Analyze alerts to determine severity and scope.  

3. **Containment, Eradication, and Recovery**  
   - Contain: Stop the incident from spreading (e.g., isolate infected hosts).  
   - Eradicate: Remove the threat (e.g., clean malware).  
   - Recover: Restore affected systems and services.  

4. **Post-Incident Activity**  
   - Document the incident and recovery process.  
   - Conduct lessons-learned reviews to strengthen defenses.  

## Practical Exercise
- Worked with a **simulated SOC dashboard** to analyze events and answer guided questions.  
- Gained experience in **identifying suspicious activity** and correlating alerts.  

## What I learnt
- Defensive security requires **continuous monitoring** and **structured response plans**.  
- The **Incident Response Lifecycle** is a universal model applied across SOCs.  
- Practical dashboards and simulations help analysts think like real SOC operators.
