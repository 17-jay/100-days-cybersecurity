# Day 10 – HTB Meow — Notes

> Basic host discovery, port scanning, and simple service interaction (ping → nmap → telnet). 



## Objective
Confirm the host is online, discover available services, interact with an exposed service (telnet), and perform basic post-login enumeration to locate the flag or proof files.



##  Emphasis was on this:
- Only test machines you are explicitly authorized to test (HTB lab, TryHackMe, your own VMs).  
- Do **not** run these commands against external IPs you do not own or have permission for.


## Check the commands.sh
