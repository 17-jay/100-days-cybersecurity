##Print Working Directory
pwd

###List directory contents
    Ls 
        #long format
        ls -l
        #show hidden files
        ls -a

    #Change Directory
    cd <path>
        #up one level
        cd ..

        #up 2 levels
        cd ../..

        # to the home directory
        cd ~

        # to  the previous directory
        cd -


## File and Directory Management
    #create an empty file
    touch filename

    #create new directory
    mkdir directoryname

    #copy files
        ##file to file
        cp file1.txt file2.txt

        ##file to different directory
        cp file.txt /home/user/documents/

        ##multiple files to a directory
        cp file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt /home/user/backups/

        ##copies all files ending with .log from the current directory to /var/log/archive/
        cp *.log /var/log/archive/

        #If new_file.txt already exists, the -i option will prompt for confirmation before overwriting it.
        cp -i existing_file.txt new_file.txt

    #move or rename
        #move file to different directory
        mv myfile.txt /home/user/documents/

        #rename file
        mv oldname.pdf newname.pdf

        #Move a directory and its contents
        mv mydirectory /var/www/html/

        #Move multiple files to a directory
        mv file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt /tmp/

    #remove a file
        #remove single file
        rm filename

        #Removing multiple files
        rm file1 file2 file3

        #confirmation before deleting each file but you can also do for multiple file
        #the big one (-I), only prompts once for all the files
        rm -i filename
        rm -I file1 file2 file3 file4

        #Removes directories and their contents recursively
        rm -r directoryname

        #-f (force): Removes files or directories without prompting for confirmation
        #rm -rf command is very powerful and can lead to data loss if used incorrectly
        rm -f filename
        rm -rf directoryname 

    #remove a directory
    rmdir directoryname



## Viewing Files
    #content of a single file
    cat filename.txt
    #display multiple files sequentially
    cat file1.txt file2.txt
    #merge the contents of multiple files into a single new file
    cat file1.txt file2.txt > newfile.txt
    #add content to the end of an existing file without overwriting it
    cat new_content.txt >> existing_file.txt

    #view file page by page
    less filename.txt

    #Displaying the first 10 lines
    head filename.txt
    #Displaying a specific number of lines
    head -n 5 filename.txt
    #displays the first 100 bytes.  -c option specifies the number of bytes. You can also use suffixes like k for kilobytes or m for megabytes
    head -c 100 filename.txt
    #Displaying output from multiple files
    head file1.txt file2.txt
    #the first 3 lines of that output
    ls -l | head -n 3
    #Displaying filename headers explicitly
    head -v filename.txt

    #Display the last lines
    tail -n 5 filename.txt



##Superuser
#'sudo' - helps to run commands with admin privileges
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade


##Permissions
#permissions of a file
    #navigate to the file's directory
    cd <path>
    #execute the following
    ls -l filename.txt
    ##RESULT-->   
    -rwxr-xr--
    ##beginning of the result
    #       - for a regular file
    #       d for a directory
    #       l for a symbolic link

    #r - Read permission
    #w - Write permission
    #x - Execute permission
    #-  - Absence of a specific permission
